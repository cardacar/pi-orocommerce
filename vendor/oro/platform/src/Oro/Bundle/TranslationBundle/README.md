# OroTranslationBundle

OroTranslationBundle allows developers to define translation strings in YAML files, it provides the translation management UI to the users and provides console commands to system administrators to update translations and to refresh the cached translations.

For more information, see online documentation on [translation and localization](https://doc.oroinc.com/backend/translations/) and [OroTranslationBundle architechture](https://doc.oroinc.com/bundles/platform/TranslationBundle/).
