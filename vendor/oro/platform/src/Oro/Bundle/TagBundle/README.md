# OroTagBundle

OroTagBundle enables tags for application entities and provides the ability for users to manage tags on entity view pages, observe them in DataGrids and use them as filtering fields in report query builders.

With the bundle, admin users can enable or disable the tag feature for particular entities in the entity management UI.

Fore more information, see [online TagBundle documentation](https://doc.oroinc.com/bundles/platform/TagBundle/).

You can also configure tags for every entity in the entity [configuration metadata](https://doc.oroinc.com/bundles/platform/EntityConfigBundle/).
