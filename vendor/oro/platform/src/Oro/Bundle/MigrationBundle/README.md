# OroMigrationBundle

OroMigrationBundle extends DBAL (database abstraction layer) and provides the ability for developers to manage and deploy changes in the Oro application database schema programmatically in a consistent, structured way using Migrations and Fixtures classes.

For more information, see online documentation on [Database Structure Migrations](https://doc.oroinc.com/backend/entities/migrations) and [Data Fixtures](https://doc.oroinc.com/backend/entities/fixtures).
